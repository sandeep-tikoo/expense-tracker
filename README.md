**CURRENTLY A WIP**

I will be posting future ideas / plans / features for this project in the issues section of this repo. I encourage people interested in helping out to do the same!

This project was started as a learning experience for me to get familiar with Angular.js, and I welcome anyone else in the web development community to take a stab at adding a feature or two :)
